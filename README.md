# PoisonXSS

![PoisonXSS Banner](https://github.com/mkhairin/poisonxss/blob/main/img/banner2.png)

PoisonXSS is a fast, flexible, and intelligent vulnerability scanner for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and HTML Injection. Built with Python and `asyncio`, PoisonXSS is capable of performing concurrent scans for maximum efficiency.

With features like an automated web crawler, technology fingerprinting, and various testing modes, PoisonXSS is designed for security professionals, bug hunters, and web developers to thoroughly test the security of web applications.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Asynchronous Scanning:** Extremely fast thanks to `asyncio` and `aiohttp`, capable of handling many requests simultaneously.
- **Dual Testing Modes:** Supports specific testing for both **XSS** and **HTML Injection**.
- **Web Crawler (Spider):** Can automatically crawl a target site to discover and test new pages.
- **Intelligence & Fingerprinting:** Can identify the technology used by the server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, WordPress) to provide context for findings.
- **Dual Target Modes:** Supports testing on a single starting URL (`-u`) or a predefined list of URLs (`-l`).
- **Professional Control:** Full support for proxies, custom headers, request delays, verbose mode, and worker count adjustment.
- **Custom Payloads:** Use your own payload lists from a file for flexible testing.
- **Reporting:** Saves scan results to a `.txt` file for documentation and further analysis.
